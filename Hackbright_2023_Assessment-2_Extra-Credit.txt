Extra Credit: Company Stack Research
* Identify 3 software or technology companies the interest you.
* Conduct research to figure out some or all of the elements of each company’s technology stack. Check job openings/job descriptions, engineering blogs, and anything else that may have information about what the company uses to write/build it’s software products.
* Record your findings in a google doc. If you can find information about why the company chose that stack, include that as well.
* Save your files and push them to GitHub with your code.


Overview
I chose my companies based on those who seemed like they were involved in the developer community and promoted open source, ethical technology. I’m interested in roles that merge technical work with community-building as well, so those are the roles I highlighted. 
One interesting thing to note is that no companies I looked at had any Junior Developer roles.


I focused on 4 areas to look into: 
* Overview and why they are focused on ethics/community/open source
* Hiring and hiring practices
* Roles that are open
* People I might know
* Their tech stack and github presence
